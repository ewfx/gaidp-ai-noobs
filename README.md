## 🎯 Introduction
This project automates data profiling for Wholesale Risk using Generative AI (Gen AI) and Unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It extracts and interprets regulatory reporting instructions, generates data validation rules, and performs adaptive risk scoring to enhance compliance and risk management in banking. The project is designed to address the challenge of automating data validation and risk assessment in regulatory reporting (FR Y-14Q Schedule H).

## 💡 Inspiration
Regulatory reporting is complex and time-consuming, requiring financial institutions to adhere to stringent data quality standards. Manual data validation is prone to errors, leading to compliance risks and regulatory penalties. Our project aims to leverage AI to automate rule generation, risk scoring, and remediation actions, ensuring accuracy, efficiency, and compliance.
